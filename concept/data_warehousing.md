# Data Warehousing

- Data Warehouse
    - Central location to store every single data
- Data Warehousing
    - Process to follow to fetch data from database and store it in DWH with the help of ETL
- ETL
    - Database → [Staging (Raw Form) ——transformation—→ Core (Curated Form)] → Data Mart
- Incremental Loading
    - Change Data Capture (CDC) will be used for incremental loading
    - Truncate will happen in Staging layer (Transient), In some cases, use Persistent
- Data Modeling
    - Process to structure data
    - Conceptual → Logical → Physical
        - Conceptual - High-level business requirements
        - Logical - Logic like connecting tables, joining attributes, E-R
        - Physical - Implementation - setting constraints, data types
- Dimensional Data Modeling
    - Store data in the form of Fact and Dimension tables
    - Fact vs Dimension
        - Fact
            - Available at the most granular format
            - Store facts that are measurements, numerical, and keys
        - Dimension
            - Do not store any numeric
            - Store context information
    - Star vs Snowflake schema
        - Star
            - 1 Fact and multiple Dimensions without any hierarchies
        - Snowflake
            - Extended version of Star
            - 1 Fact but multiple Dimensions with hierarchies (eg., product has category)
- Fact Table Types
    - Granular/Transactional Fact Table
        - 1 transaction = 1 row
    - Periodic Fact Table
        - Snapshot Fact Table
        - 1 row ≠ 1 transaction
        - 1 row = monthly transactions
    - Accumulating Fact Table
        - 1 row = 1 process (journey of a transaction)
- Dimension Table Types
    - Conformed Dimension
        - One dimension has more than one fact tables
    - Role Playing Dimension
        - One dimension has more than one different roles (columns) with a fact table
    - Junk Dimension
        - One dimension has only one or two unique values in its column
    - Degenerate Dimension
        - One dimension has no context and only ID and key.
- Slowly Changing Dimension
    - Type-0
        - No change
    - Type-1
        - Upsert
    - Type-2
        - History
    - Type-3
        - Prev Value
